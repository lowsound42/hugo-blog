I have tried to get started with a personal blog a few times before this. This thing has been a Wordpress site, a React app,
a plain HTML and vanilla JS site when I was experiencing my "back to basics" moment, a NextJS SSR beast,
and probably other stuff as well. I'm back now with what has been the easiest and most relaxing way to get this up; Hugo.

My mind has experienced the most horrific social media induced brainrot over the past few years and by the time I catch myself doomscrolling,
I'm already thirty minutes into a session. I have to break the hold that the garbage internet has on me and intentionally remove myself from
it. Part of my journey out of this space is getting into writing and documenting things. I'd rather spend my time creating something than
passively receive trash 'content'.

So anyway, here's the latest incarnation of my blog. I hope it lasts this time.
